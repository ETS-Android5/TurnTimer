# TurnTimer
TurnTimer is an Android app that resembles a Chess clock, with the tweak of being able to have a dynamic amount of timers.
This is used for a variety of board games other than Chess.

The user is able to adjust:
- the amount of timers
- mode in which they are ticking (countdown or stopwatch)
- start time of the countdown
- whether or not the state of the application should be saved
